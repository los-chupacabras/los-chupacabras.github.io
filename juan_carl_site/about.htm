	<blockquote>The genre of League of Legends is what is known as a MOBA &#40;Multiplayer Online Battle Arena&#41;,  type of game where teams of players battle to 
		destroy the enemy teams base.</br></br>
		In League of Legends, two 5-player teams play on a map known as the Summoners Rift &#40;image below&#41; to destroy the main gem inside their base, known as a nexus.
		These players use characters known as Champions, to battle as a team to charge down any of the three lanes in the map to get to the enemy base. Each of these lanes, as well as the nexus, are protected
		by turrets, which are designed to shoot down any unit that is not of their teams' side. The nexus of each team also releases what is known as minions, units that travel through
		each of the 3 lanes to help attack any enemy unit or turret. Players must battle in each lane defeating enemy champions and their minions, while using their own minions to destroy enemy towers and advance towards the nexus.

		A League of Legends team consists of 5 roles &#40;each explained below&#41;:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#top">Top Laner</a></li>
			<li><a href="#jungle">Jungler</a></li>
			<li><a href="#mid">Mid Laner</a></li>
			<li><a href="#adc">ADC</a></li>
			<li><a href="#support">Support</a></li>
		</ul>

		</br>
			Top Laners, as the name states, are players who play during the early stages of the game in the top lane of the map. Top laners are generally known for not getting a lot of help
			from their teammates in other lanes, and only leaving the top lane when there is an opportunity to help their allies. Top laners generally use champions that are useful when building a lot of health or armor,
			champions who make use out of being able to tank most of the damage from the enemy team. As a top laner it is important to be able to defend your lane consistently and pressure the enemy top laner without taking too
			many risks, since generally you'll be alone dealing with this enemy for the most part. It is also important to be able to take advantage out of any opportunity of help from your jungler or mid laner, since these moments
			can change the pace of your lane and make the time they invested in helping you worth it.

		</br>
			Junglers are players who play in the spaces between the lanes, known as the jungle, for the most part of the game. Their objective is to support their teammates in any of the 3 lanes, either by defeating neutral monsters within
			the jungle that can give advantages to the team, or by what is known as "ganking", or invading a teammates lane in an attempt to catch the enemy laner off guard and defeat them or to help destroy enemy towers. Junglers generally 
			use champions that have the ability to defeat the monsters in the jungle at a good pace while maintaining good health, as well as champions who have abilities with CC &#40;Crowd Control&#41; Effects, abilities that
			can trap an enemy champion by slowing them, stunning them, making them unable to use abilities, etc.

		</br>
			Mid laners are players who play the early stages of the game in the middle lane of the map. Mid laners are generally  very mechanically skilled players since the middle lane of the map is considered a very important are to
			capture and defend for both teams. For this reason, mid laners usually get constant assistance from the jungler when possible, giving the mid laner monsters from the jungle to help him get strong faster and continue battling, 
			as well as often helping with ganks. Mid laners use champions that can do a lot of damage through their abilities and normally get items that mostly focus on increasing their damage and worrying about defense later on, 
			as opposed to top laners who typically focus on defense. For these reasons mid laners are generally mechanically skilled, since landing their abilities or avoiding damage from the enemy mid laner is very crucial to champions
			focused mainly on damage, as well they must be able to react to a gank opportunity or gank threat as fast as possible.
		</br>

		</br>
			ADC's or Attack Damage Carry's, are players who play the early stages of the game in the bottom lane of the map, normally accompanied by a support player. ADC's get their name due to the fact that they are players who
			focus solely on increasing their damage, and look to be the main source of damage for their team. ADC's use champions that are ranged and typically benefit from the increased damaged on their basic attacks. ADC's 
			need to be mechanically skilled players who can always be alert throughout the game, due to the fact that their champions produce great amounts of damage but are very weak themselves, thus becoming the target of the enemy
			team later on. ADC's are accompanied by a support player for this reason, so they can depend on the support to defend them while they attack the enemy. It is also important that an ADC be constantly trying to gain gold
			as often as they can, in order to obtain the most damage possible in the least amount of time.

		</br>
			Supports are players who join their ADC in the bottom lane of the map during the early stages of the game. Supports a players who focus on keeping their ADC safe from any harm, as well as setting up fights so that
			the ADC can attack from a safe distance. Supports also focus on maintaining vision around the bottom lane so they are safe from any possible gank intentions or to set up a gank from their own jungler. Supports use champions
			that generally have abilities to either keep ally champions safe by shielding them, healing them, transporting them, etc., or abilities to capture an enemy and restrict them so their ADC can attack them. A support should always
			keep in mind that their ADC comes first in any situation, and they must do anything possible to assure their ADC becomes a strong source of damage for the team.
