				<center><h3>Content Transformation</h3></center>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content Transformation is the process of changing the content requested to the server by a user to certain specifications of the user in
					order to give a better user experience of the content. Content transformation is mainly used for when the user is accessing a web site or application
					from a device that is not a PC, such as a smartphone or tablet, to transform the  content &#40;such as the appearance or placement of elements&#41; 
					of the web site to better fit the device of the user. Content transformation works via a proxy server &#40;server that works as an intermediary between
					the user and the server&#41; that alters the requests made by users, as well as the responses made by the server, to better fit the user.
				</p>
				<img src="content_transformation.png" size="50%">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proxies that perform these alterations can be of two types defined by HTTP &#40;Hypertext Transfer Protocol&#41;. 
					These are the <b>Transparent Proxies</b> and <b>Non-Transparent Proxies.</b> Transparent Proxies are proxy servers that cannot alter requests from a user
					 or responses from a server beyond what is necessary to be accepted by the proxy. Non-Transparent Proxies are ones that can go further than transparent and provide some specified additional alteration, in this
					case for the sake of successful content transformation.The requests of the user can be changed in many ways, including possible ways specified by the user.
					One example of this is a request from a user that involves retreiving an element that the user agent may not know if it can handle. In this case the request could
					be transformed to determine if that certain element is acceptable and then retreiving it as originally requested. The responses of the server are altered in three main ways:
				<ol>
					<li> <p><b>Restructuring the content of the response.</b></p>
						<blockquote>
							This method is focused on the layout of the page being requested, formatting things like the sizes of certain
							elements or spaces to better fit the device being used. It can also change the format of future requests to make access to the corresponding
							proxy simpler.
						</blockquote>
					<li> <p><b>Recoding the content of the response.</b></p>
						<blockquote>
							This method focuses on changing the actual encoding of the requested site to fit XHTML requirements. This method also helps make
							some corrections to elements of the code if necessary.
						</blockquote>
					<li> <p><b>Optimizing the content of the response.</b></p>
						<blockquote>
							This method involves removing unnecessary spaces or preparing the code for sending.
						</blockquote>
				</ol>
				<p>	
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth noting that proxies should be careful to not make the same requests to the server too often, since
					this can cause  an unnecessary workload on the server. It is also important to note that these proxy servers should present the user
					with the option of selecting any content transformation or not, no matter the default settings of the user may be. Proxies should also avoid
					transforming content when it is not found necessary, such as when the HTML document contains options in it already for other devices, the type
					of document or content is one already associated with a type for mobile devices, the responses or requests already have data prepared to handle
					a mobile device, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Content Transformation is a useful tool for handling the ever changing amount of devices that have the 
					ability to access web content, and can do this in various ways to deal with those different cases.
